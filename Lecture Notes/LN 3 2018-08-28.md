# Class Housekeeping

## review: we have covered
* levels of abstraction
* structure of file system
* terminal
* bash commands for file system

## objectives for this class
* go through HW0
* overview git
* bash commands for file and process management
* wildcards, regular expressions

# HW0

Go through HW0 (expect details on git next time)

# textwrangler

to edit text files like md, which you view in github

# jupyter notebooks
* server: start in command line

* cells have text and executable code
	* add cells of the *right type*
	* enter text or code
		* tab completion
	* execute (format or run) cell with shift-enter
	* checkpoint and save
	
# More Bash

## System Variables

* set
* $PATH

## more file stuff

* file names and "extensions"

* ls, ls -la, cd, pwd
	* Permissions, chmod
	* hidden files (~/.bash_profile)
* head, tail
* less
* \* as a wildcard 
	* in \~/tmp: ls b; ls b\*; ls b*\*
	* works for all bash commands: touch, cat, rm, ...

## streams and pipes

* echo
* I/O, STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR
* |, >, <

* wc (show example on fasta file)
* file

## processes

* describe what they are
* ps, who, sort

* ctl-C stops processes
* ctl-Q force quits what is running

## Information
* man, less

# (time permitting) Regular expressions and grep 

Sample files in tmp: grep_example.txt and grep2_example.txt

* grep for strings in a file or bunch of files: 
	* grep "THIS" grep_example.txt
	* grep "THIS" grep\*
* case insensitive
	* grep -i "THIS" grep_example.txt
* Using patterns
	* grep 197? grep_example.txt
	* grep 19\* grep_example.txt
	* rep B* grep_example.txt
	* grep i. grep_example.txt (period for single character)
* Sets
	*  grep [Bb].* grep_example.txt (character sets)
*  Using pattern modifiers
	* grep [aA]nd grep_example.txt
	* grep ^[aA]nd grep_example.txt (^ as beginning marker)
	* grep e.$ grep_example.txt ($ as end marker)
	* grep ^$ grep_example.txt
* useful flags
	* grep -c (count) 
	* grep -n (show line number)
	* grep -w (limit match to full words)
	* grep -i (ignore case)

## relation to other bash commands

regular expressions in bash

* ls 19\*
* ls [aA]nd


## Putting It All Together

/sequences_milk.fasta has 5,379,622 DNA sequences (a **small** HiSeq run)

show comment format. Includes: person's name, which gene this is for, primers, and more.

* How many sequences for FUT2 gene?
* How many people from Ghana (GN*)
* How many records for person GN531?
* How many FUT2 genes were sequenced from Ghana?

Do grep. pipe to wc, less, grep -c, etc.
