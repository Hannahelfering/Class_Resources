Plan for today:

Basic data structures (3.1): Lists, slices, tuples, dicts

## control flow
	* boolean comparisons: ==, <, <=, ...
	* if/else
	* for

range()
len()

# Compound data structures

## Lists

* empty list
* entries can be *anything* (including other lists)
	* there are no matrixes or tensors, just lists of lists

### Useful members
* append()
* pop()
* + (catenation)
* sort()

list() can be useful (e.g. list('acgnntt'))

for *member* in *list*

### Indexing Slicing
* describe

use as examples:  nucleotides = ["A","C","G","T","N","Y","U"]

>goodReads=nucleotides[0:4] or goodReads=nucleotides[:4]

>ambiguousReads=nucleotides[4:] or ambiguousReads=nucleotides[4:8]

* negative indexes

> nucleotides[-2]
> nucleotides[:-2]

* stepsize

>nucleotides[::2]
>nucleotides[::-1] # cute

* biggest slice is a **copy**. very common construction

>nucsCopy=nucleotides[:]

### Compare to strings

```
DNA_string = 'AAUUUGYCCAANN'
DNA_list = list(DNA_string) # casting, or coercion
```

* mutability

```
DNA_list[1] = 'X'
DNA_list
DNA_string[1] = 'X'
```

(for fun, what happens with *str(DNA_list)*?)

### Reference Versus Value #####

direct assignment of larger objects (like lists) are *references*, 
because **everything in python is an object**

* List example

>bad_copy=nucleotides

*bad_copy* *is* the nucleotides  *object* (not a new object with the same value)

```
bad_copy
bad_copy[1]="foobar"
bad_copy
nucleotides
```

Use copying

```
good_copy = nucleotides[:]
good_copy[1]="foobar"
good_copy
nucleotides
```

## control flow
	* boolean comparisons: ==, <, <=, ...
	* if/else
	* for

range()
len()
